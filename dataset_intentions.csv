""coral gables is, perhaps, the most notable example of a modern city planned and built according to one concept and unified design. growth and development have meant here only a constant enlargement and progressive expansion of the original ideal."" ~ coral gables: its advantages for good living for healthful recreation for the enjoyment of rest or vacation -- or for profitable business or industry"" complied for the chamber of commerce, coral gables, miami, florida, 1927 returning public places back to the people over time, many of the original coral gables public spaces that were envisioned to be places for people have diminished with asphalt, high speeds, and other unfriendly traffic-related interventions. though many of these public spaces have been eroded through the past several decades that have resulted to be less accessible to people, the city of coral gables is actively addressing this need to provide quality places for people as was inherent in the original ideals and vision of merrick‚äôs plan. quality places for people projects the city of coral gables planning and public works departments are currently focusing to work with the community and improve four important areas ‚äì coral way plazas, desoto plaza, biltmore way, and university of miami neighborhood - each unique in scale and community function. many of these projects have already gathered important ideas and feedback from the community, which is vital in restoring and transforming these places to provide a higher quality of life. coral way plazas (granada and columbus) the plazas throughout coral gables are significant features of merrick‚äôs plan and illustrate his original vision for quality places for people. these plazas - designed as circular garden rooms - were originally planned to mark major intersections by incorporating garden walls, gateways, pergolas, and fountains. people and drivers were envisioned to equally enjoy these garden-like spaces that became the character of coral gables. however, the coral way plazas ‚äì specifically at granada and columbus ‚äì have deteriorated with the widening of asphalt for increased auto speeds and lack of maintained for pedestrian amenities. continuing to collaborate closely with the neighbors, the city can restore the original balance between pedestrians and drivers to create a quality place for people . more info desoto plaza & fountain one of the more significant and recognizable coral gables plazas is the desoto plaza, at the intersection of granada and de soto boulevard. this beautiful fountain is part of the series of public places and structures originally planned between the historic alhambra (commercial) entrance, city hall, and the biltmore hotel. similar to the other original plazas, the desoto plaza was also meant to be a balanced and garden-like space for people walking and driving to equally enjoy. the intersection, however, has changed over time to currently not fulfil merrick‚äôs original intent of a balanced space for people to share, and is often confusing to navigate through safely. the city will start to collaborate with interested residents to restore this important monument as a quality place for people as originally envisioned. biltmore way original plans of coral gables illustrate the careful consideration of street widths, creating a purposeful hierarchy of wide boulevards for circulation that organized a network of smaller neighborhood streets. merrick had a grand vision for biltmore way, as it is a wide boulevard that provides a direct connection between the single-family neighborhoods and downtown coral gables. however throughout the last several decades, biltmore way has become less of a connection and more of a separation for people who wish to access downtown from their homes. the city is continuing to work with residents to fulfill the original vision that merrick had for this important connection as a quality place for people. more info university of miami neighborhood the immediate residential community that surrounds the university of miami is a unique single-family neighborhood with close proximity to the campus‚äô tropical landscape and quality community programs and events. merrick placed a great emphasis on higher education as he designed the master plan for coral gables and demonstrated this with his donation of 600 acres of land and pledge of $5 million. as the campus has developed and grown through the decades, access around the campus for residents has made these neighborhood streets uncomfortable for people. with funds provided by the university of miami, the city will continue to work together with neighbors to address current concerns in the area. contact getting involved will give you a chance to express your vision for the future of your community. tell us what you love best about the public spaces in coral gables, and help us guide the evolution of these places for people. the city welcomes your feedback and wants to hear from you. email us learn about master plans -

however, the neighborhood was not built out until the 1940's and 1950's. community vision the flagler section community vision workshop kicked-off with a walking tour to give residents the opportunity to share with the design team what they love about their community and what can continue to be improved in the neighborhood. the workshop continued with a hands-on session so that the members of the community can bring their ideas - big and small - to share with the design team, city staff, and their neighbors of how to make the flagler section an even better neighborhood for everyone. after conceptual design concepts and options were developed using the ideas and input from the neighborhood, these concepts were discussed with interested residents at a neighborhood presentation. all events presented in partnership with dover, kohl & partners. plan implementation the city budgeted preliminary engineering services in october 2019 to analyze the possible improvements to streets within the flagler section based on the 2019 community vision. this capital improvement project started in february 2020 with surveying of the streets and other public rights-of-way in the neighborhood. street design alternatives and cost estimates are being finalized and will be presented and discussed with the neighborhood in winter 2020/2021 or once it is safe to conduct in-person community meetings. follow this project page or contact the planning division for any updates. existing conditions in the flagler section below are a series of interactive maps that include the existing zoning;

""effective planning is compounded of vision and the proper application of that vision."" ~ george merrick, visionary and founder of coral gables, 1927 how your community's master plan is built the implementation of a master plan may be built as a single capital improvement project or several individual projects to fulfill the desires of the community. * capital project selection before the start of each fiscal year in october, the city commission selects a range of capital improvement projects as supported by the strategic plan and other master plans. * design development with an approved budget, the conceptual designs are developed and assessed to be feasible based on initial design concepts presented to the community during the creation of the plan. * update to community the developed designs and estimated schedule is finalized and presented to the community and stakeholders. * project construction with the funds allocated in the project's budget, the specific capital improvement project is designed and built according to the community vision. town planning in coral gables ""coral gables is, perhaps, the most notable example of a modern city planned and built according to one concept and unified design. growth and development have meant here only a constant enlargement and progressive expansion of the original ideal."" ~ coral gables: its advantages for good living for healthful recreation for the enjoyment of rest of vacation - or for profitable business or industry"" complied for the chamber of commerce, coral gables, miami, florida, 1927 coral gables, ""miami's master suburb"" town plan, showing original design of plazas, october 1921. image credit: historymiami coral gables, ""miami's master suburb"" town plan, showing original design of the granada golf course, october 1921. image credit: historymiami coral gables, ""miami's suburb distinctive"" town plan july 1921. image credit: historymiami early town plans for the design of coral gables addressed the need for open space, civic space, and a variety of street types. this 1921 drawing by w.c. bliss and frank button shows plans for a proposed ""electric railroad,"" or streetcar, running along alhambra circle, the granada golf course fronted by home sites, and the coral gables club house at the corner of north greenway drive and granada boulevard. it also shows the plazas along coral way, which remain a notable part of coral gables today. the original deeds to the lots in coral gables included numerous restrictions, including architectural style, building setbacks, fence types, and street frontage. many of these restrictions were incorporated into the zoning code, and today they are located in appendix a, site specific regulations. (other regulations have also been incorporated into appendix a over the years.) george merrick controlled the street frontage of buildings along major streets in order to create a consistent character for people passing by. the character of public space in coral gables was carefully designed, from the width of streets to the creation of unique plazas, parks, and civic buildings. the town plan of july 1921 shows the original design for ponce de leon plaza on coral way, just a block west of the merrick house. note the concept of simple curved walls anchored by piers. the design was further refined in the october 1921 plan, which includes a wider right-of-way around ponce de leon plaza to create a greater feeling of openness. the town plan of july 1921 also shows the careful consideration of street widths, creating a hierarchy of grand 100' wide boulevards for circulation and for displaying big house on large lots, to smaller 60' wide streets fronted by lots with more modest homes. ""cordova, an old palace"" lesser known architecture of spain, 1925 h. george fink office, 1925 a spanish village ""in beautiful and simple construction, in arches and in masses, in design which makes everything harmonious, the architects of coral gables have followed the great masters, have rooted their work in with the roots of the greatest."" ~ coral gables miami riviera, 1923 the architects of the 1920s drew their inspiration from travel and from books. george merrick and his team of architects decided that spanish, and later mediterranean architecture, adapted to the south florida climate, was the ideal character for the new town of coral gables. in order to develop a new architecture that evoked the character of spain, architects relied on books of photos and drawings of spain and the mediterranean. these books were a standard part of an architect's library during this time. ""always it seemed to me that there should be the same class of houses and surroundings which were along the shores of the mediterranean. geographically and climatically, south florida is identified with spain, north africa, and all that lies between them and the south sea islands."" ~george merrick, 1925 development history of coral gables coral gables began as a small plantation of 160 acres, five miles west of miami. visionary george merrick and landscape architect, frank m. button, master planned coral gables far beyond the typical concepts of subdivisions of housing within a gridiron pattern of streets. the original plan for coral gables consisted of 1200 acres, starting with the platting of 'section a' in 1921, and established coral way as the major east-west axis and granada boulevard as the major north-south axis. the first stage of growth, 1921 through 1925, consisted mostly north of bird road, even as other development sections were platted to the south. the second stage of growth were portions of the riviera section and the university of miami - a critically important aspect in merrick's vision. the third stage was never realized due to the hurricane of 1926. ""on all the principal boulevards at coral gables have been laid out delightful parks, plazas and rest spots... whenever possible fruit trees in the parkways between sidewalks and streets have been preserved, and for miles the visitor to coral gables walks through veritable bowers laden with delectable fruit."" ~ frank m. button, 1921 1921 1922 1923 1924 1925 1926 1927 1928 ""coral gables was the center of the most spectacular real estate promotion in the history of our country. the city was planned on a scale adequate for a population of more than a quarter of a million."" ~ financial and administrative survey of the city of coral gables municipal consultant service of the national municipal league, 1934 past public workshops the city of coral gables continues to work along side citizens and stakeholders in various parts of the city to create a vision for the local community. ""a well planned city, beautiful homes, widest range of scholastic activities, with the material, the communal, the municipal and the cultural phases of life fittingly rounded out by those religious organizations, so especially a part of the foundation of american life and outlook - the whole developing a highly conscious citizenship. that is coral gables."" ~ george merrick, coral gables facts, january 1927 current master plans and community visions in coral gables master plans for neighborhoods, districts, and city-wide provide creative and innovative guidance for the effective implementation of development, planning, transportation, housing, and environment policies, in order to maintain the city as a safe, vital and attractive community and enhance the high quality of life, health, safety, and welfare. to learn more about the different planning initiatives in coral gables, both current and past, please click on the images below. the bicycle / pedestrian plan was adopted by the city commission in 2014 to create an interconnected network of bicycle and pedestrian routes of 34 additional miles. the primary purpose of the plan is to recommend projects that can be implemented with the initial investment of $400,000 from 2010. the coral gables charrette report was a robust public process in 2002 to revitalize downtown coral gables and the north ponce neighborhood by focusing on history, specific area plans, public space, streetscape, transportation, and housing. the comprehensive plan was adopted in 2010 and expresses and regulates public policies based on community goals and objectives on mobility, land use, design, recreation, housing, and other important aspects of coral gables. the comprehensive plan has been amended as directed and adopted by the city commission. the design / industrial district master plan was prepared in 1997 to create a vision and preliminary urban design strategies. the master plan includes development strategies and urban design regulations for the 34 blocks and 20 streets of design / industrial district. the downtown coral gables retail strategy of 2016 focuses on miracle mile and key surrounding streets to develop a strategy to enhance the shopping and dining experience. the flagler section community vision of 2019 creates a long-term vision for the neighborhood north of sw 8th street. the parks and community recreation and war memorial center master plan (in-progress) creates a road map to enrich the lives of our residents. the north ponce de leon blvd area and commercial business district master landscape plan of 2005 is the guiding tool for public rights-of-way treatment implements the 2002 charrette's vision to improve the quality of life and provide a pedestrian-friendly environment. the north ponce community vision of 2015 informs the future planning and development of the north ponce to study the area that was previously examined as part of the 2002 charrette. the 2020-2022 strategic plan is the city's road map toward performance excellence and realizing the city's vision of being ""a world-class city with a hometown feel."" the 2015 sustainability master plan contains the vision to preserve the city's historic heritage, enhance local and global environment quality, enrich our local economy and strengthen the health and well-being of our residents, businesses, and visitors. the comprehensive multimodal transportation plan creates a transportation network that enhancesthe efficiency and effectiveness of mobility choices for residents, business community, and the general public. the us1 * red * sunset vision of 2015 informs the future planning and development of the us1 corridor area to manage the ongoing changes taking place in the area and engage citizens and stakeholders in a dialog. the university of miami campus master plan is an adopted plan and legal document that provides a framework for academic and residential development within the main campus. find your community's plan or vision [under construction] type in an address or zoom to the area to find the specific master plan or community vision for your neighborhood. additional resources learn specific information as it relates to zoning, land use, historic preservation, and mobility options being planned in the city. coral gables parcel information center this interactive web application contains useful, public information on each coral gables property. explore historic districts & properties multi-layer web map application for historical homes and districts in coral gables. explore capital improvement projects pilot draft map for assessment by pw cip division explore bicycle master plan bicycle master plan explore planning division development services phone : 305-460-5211 email : planning@coralgables.com address : 427 biltmore way, coral gables, fl 33134 follow follow","master planning,coral gables planning,coral gables master planning,current master plans",get_master_planning_in_coral_gables
